**Welcome to Pentaho CDE NewMapComponent Samples**
========

This is a library with a lot of NewMapComponent samples.

Almost all samples go beyond the OOTB features due to limitations on the component. To achieve some behaviors on the samples, was needed add extra JS code calling the map engine API.

All the samples are based on RequireJS dashboards.

We invite all those pentaho users to share their maps charts on this library as well.
